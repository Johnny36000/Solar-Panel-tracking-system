**Single Axis Solar Panel Tracking System**
An intelligent solar tracking system that automatically follows the sun's movement throughout the day to maximize solar panel efficiency using Arduino-based control and light-dependent sensors.

**Project Overview**
This project implements a single-axis solar tracking system designed to optimize solar panel positioning for maximum energy harvesting. The system continuously monitors light intensity from different directions and automatically adjusts the solar panel orientation to maintain perpendicular alignment with the sun, significantly improving power generation efficiency compared to fixed solar installations.

**Key Features**:

- Automatic sun tracking from east to west throughout the day

- Real-time monitoring with LCD display

- Light-based positioning using dual LDR sensor configuration

- Servo motor actuation for precise panel movement

- Microcontroller-based intelligence for autonomous operation

**System Architecture
Core Components**:

- Arduino Mega 2560 - Main control unit with ATmega328 microcontroller

- Dual LDR modules - Light intensity sensors for directional detection

- LCD display - Real-time system status and performance monitoring

- Servo motor - Panel positioning actuator

- Solar panel - Energy harvesting unit

**Working Principle**
The tracking system operates on a comparative light sensing algorithm that continuously evaluates light intensity from different directions:

**Three-State Operation**:

*Sun Position Left (East)*:

- LDR1 receives higher light intensity

- LDR2 is shadowed by the barrier

- System rotates solar panel clockwise toward the light source

*Sun Position Right (West)*:

- LDR2 receives higher light intensity

- LDR1 is shadowed by the barrier

- System rotates solar panel counterclockwise toward the light source

*Sun Position Center*:

- Both LDRs receive equal light intensity

- Panel remains stationary in optimal position

**Design Implementation
Sensor Configuration**:
The two LDRs are strategically positioned on opposite sides of the solar panel with a physical barrier between them. This arrangement creates a shadow effect that enables the system to determine the sun's relative position and calculate the required panel adjustment.

**Control Algorithm**:
The Arduino continuously reads analog voltage values from both LDR sensors, converts them using the built-in ADC, and compares the readings. Based on the voltage difference, the microcontroller generates appropriate PWM signals to control servo motor movement.

**Servo Motor Control**:
The system uses PWM signals to control servo positioning, with pulse widths determining the exact angle of rotation. The servo motor provides precise angular control typically ranging from 0° to 180°, enabling accurate solar panel alignment.
